# image_memification
Small idea I got from a meme. Draws an image making horizontal lines appear in random locations. Might be used for pictionary sessions idek.

Needs: 
- OpenCV
- sklearn
- PIL (? I used it in a portion of code that's not longer used in simplifier.py so it might be deleted)
- uuhh that should be it

Start with:
```bash
python.exe .\video_writer.py -i image_path -c n_colors -fn video_output_name
```
